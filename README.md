The Tower is a dark fantasy mod for Minecraft I am producing.

As this is the first time I am using Java, I am using an LLM to produce most of the code while learning from it.
I of course have a long way to go, but I hope to one day say that Minecraft taught me Java. 

So if you see anything stupid in my code, I hope you recognise it was due to my inexperience with the language and not my own stupidity. Although some people might argue that that is the same thing.
