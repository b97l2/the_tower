The Tower is a 32x32 pixel dark fantasy mod for Minecraft I am producing.

__________________________________________________________________________________
As this is the first time I am using Java, I am using an LLM to produce most of the code while learning from it.
I of course have a long way to go, but I hope to one day say that Minecraft taught me Java. 

So if you see anything stupid in my code, I hope you recognise it was due to my inexperience with the language and not my own stupidity. Although some people might argue that that is the same thing. 

All textures are made by me unless otherwise stated.
